.. Hint::
   This package is deprecated and no further development is intended; use
   `collective.portlet.twitter`_ instead.

This package allows you to add different kinds of portlets to your site to get
tweets.

This package depends on `collective.twitter.accounts`_.

Don't Panic

- Add a "Twitter profile Portlet" wherever you want.
- Enter a header (if you want one).
- Choose the Twitter_ account to use from the drop-down (see Prerequisites).
- Enter the user you want to get the feed from. (username can be with @ or
  not).
- Mark the checkbox for showing the avatars next to the username, or leave it
  unmarked for not.
- Choose the maximum results you want to show each time.

Twitter search portlet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add a "Twitter search Portlet" wherever you want.
- Enter a header (if you want one).
- Choose the Twitter_ account to use from the drop-down (see Prerequisites).
- Enter the search string you want to use.
- Mark the checkbox for showing the avatars next to the username, or leave it

Extras

  results
- Click on an "@" starting word (usernames) to go to the user profile in
  Twitter.
